# DANIEL: A fast Document Attention Network for Information Extraction and Labelling of handwritten documents

This repository will contain the official implementation of the paper: "DANIEL: A fast Document Attention Network for Information Extraction and Labelling of handwritten documents" once I have finished writing my thesis manuscript.

The paper is available at [https://hal.science/hal-04555188](https://hal.science/hal-04555188).
