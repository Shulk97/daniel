# DANIEL: A fast Document Attention Network for Information Extraction and Labelling of handwritten documents

**Update**: The publication of the code and weights is scheduled for March 2025.

This repository will contain the official implementation of the paper: "DANIEL: A fast Document Attention Network for Information Extraction and Labelling of handwritten documents" once I have finished writing my thesis manuscript.

The paper is available at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09103](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09103).

The repository will contain training and inference code as well as the synthetic data generator.

Training weights will be published on Zenodo.
